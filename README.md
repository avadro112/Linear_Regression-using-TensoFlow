# Python
this is code is so called regression because better it can be used for cost function analysis /gradients estimation/loss value using graphs(matplotlib)

 contains only template for implementing a tensorflow regression model
 My machine learning is still under practice 
 out there might be better method/algorithms
! making a simple regression model in SciKit Learn library is way more easier.
using tensorflow for this simple and basic regression model will be more time taking.
